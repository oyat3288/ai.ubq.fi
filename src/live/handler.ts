/**
 * Serves the Codex realtime voice relay; null when the request is not a
 * `/v1/live` route.
 *
 * The two JSON arms receive the standard `withCors`/`withRequestId`
 * decorations here instead of in `src/handler/index.ts`, because the sideband's
 * 101 upgrade response must be returned exactly as `Deno.upgradeWebSocket`
 * produced it: wrapping it in a new `Response` drops the associated socket.
 * Authentication runs before either arm, and before the sideband upgrade reads
 * nothing but headers - reading the request body would fail the handshake. The
 * resolved principal is passed to both arms so the call is bound to the one
 * credential that created it and only that principal may join its sideband.
